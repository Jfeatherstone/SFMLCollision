 * @brief This class contains several different mathematical operations and calculations used
 * to apply transformations, find dot/cross products, and several other use cases. All methods
 * defined in this class are static (and any new additions should follow suit), though there is
 * no other connection between the functions. Also, not all functions use vectors, as the name
 * might suggest, but rather that they have to deal with directionality.
